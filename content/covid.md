Summary: Covid data with the context to understand it

# Biases

First, let me say that everything you see a graph remember that a graph is "an argument made visual".
The person that created the graph had a point they wanted to make.  That point might have been from
an objective point of view, or not.

Given that, let me state my bias up front. I want thing to reopen.  I hate not being able to go to
a restaurant or a bar. I believe that shutting everything down when we knew nothing was the right,
although painful, thing to do but as long as we stay shutdown we learn nothing.  I believe we get
through this by learning enough to manage our way through it so we have to do something, not stay
in this state.

# Interesting Data

Data won't tell us what to do. It can inform us but our own beliefs will color what we believe the
right thing to do with the data is.  He is an example of what I mean.

We know that the shelter-in-place reduces the spread of Covid19.  It also keeps people with heart 
problems out of the hospital and places homeless people at increased risk. How do you balance those
groups?  There is no mathematics that allows you to balance that.  It will always be a judgement call.

## How is Santa Clara doing?

First and foremost, this is a local issue.  Santa Clara is not Santa Cruz, it's not LA, it's not 
Fresno.  If you want to understand Covid19, start at the local level where you can understand it
best.  The best data for Santa Clara is the [county webpage](https://www.sccgov.org/sites/covid19/Pages/dashboard.aspx)

There is a lot of data there. For me, the most interesting graph at the site is the "New Cases by
Specimen Collection Date". When I look at this I see that during March, cases were increasing but
that in the last several weeks, we have about 30-50 cases per day.

Note: when looking at any Covid19 graphs it is good to remember:
* data collection is uneven, it's often terrible on the weekend, there are catch-up days, etc.
* trends are good, day-by-day number are not
* often, sources are going back and changing old data

We don't see the number of cases going to zero but rather staying at a somewhat constant low
level. A safe, tolerable level.

# Is this really worse than other flu years

On the whole, so far, no.  A typical flu year will cause 30,000-60,000 deaths.  We've had good years and 
bad years. That does not mean that Covid19 is just another flu. We need to remember that we have managed
to keep Covid19 deaths at 50,000 **only because of the shelter-in-place**.  Had we not done that and treated
this as a regular flu year we could expect all states to look like New York.  Many states, by taking action,
prevented this scenario.  Because it was prevented, we don't know what it would have looked like but we know
it would include more than 50,000 deaths.

For me, the data that really got me to understand this issue was this article.  Seeing the rate of Covid19
compared to the rate of other deaths really resonated with me.  Yes, people die of many other things but
with Covid19, these deaths have occurred in just 2 months, not 12.

# Things to watch for

Whether listening to people's arguments, looking at their graphs, reading their stories it helps to
know some of the telltale signs of people misusing data. Sometimes this misuse is on purpose but way
more often, people are just forgetting some basic principles. Here are some basic things to watch for.

## Data extrapolation

This argument goes like "I tested 100 people and 2 were sick so 2% of all people are sick". This will
only be true if the people you tested are a completely random sample. When it comes to testing people
for Covid19 the testing is never random so you can never extrapolate the results to everyone.

## Changing timescales

This argument goes like this 50,000 people die of car accidents and 50,000 people have died from Covid19
so it is no worse than car accidents.  What if we instead change this to per month instead of per year?
It would be 35,000 people died from Covid this month but 4,200 people died in car accidents.  Or what if
we compared on a 10 year scale?  500,000 people died in car accidents and 50,000 from Covid19.  The time
scale completely changes the message.  You have to make sure the timescale being used makes sense.
