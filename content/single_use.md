Summary: Trying to eliminate single use drinking containers is hard!

When most of the [recycling centers in California](https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2019/08/06/californias-largest-recycling-center-business-closes-shuttering-300-redemption-centers-2/) shut down in the summer of 2019, it made me realize that using that just because something is recyclable it does not mean that it is being recycled. For a few years I had been bringing my own cup to Starbucks to keep from wasting a paper cup every day. If I am worried about wasting a biodegradable paper cup, then I should be even more concerned about using water bottles that are not.

At about the same time, I ran into [PathWater](https://drinkpathwater.com/) and their goal to reduce plastic waste by offering an alternative. I decided that I try to eliminate my use of single-use drinking containers, including all plastic water bottles, cups, and as much as possible paper cups also. I was used to carrying a water bottle, so I thought this would not be that hard.  My goal was to go a full month without a single wasted container.

I started in September, and to date, I have not made it a full month.  I've come close but often find small things tripping me up. The first challenge was airplanes that serve everything in disposable cups. Another was using the cup at the water dispenser at the doctor.  Or, getting a drink at a bar that serves in plastic cups. I quickly came to realize that we have integrated disposable plastic cups into our lives in a way that will not be easy to resolve. Most of these cups could be replaced with biodegradable ones, which would be a step in the right direction. On the positive side, I have not used a single-use plastic water bottle in 6 months.

A much bigger problem is plastic water bottles. As I was walking by the end of the Santa Cruz half marathon this morning, I noticed they were giving each participant a bottle of water and a bottle of Gatorade, two single-use water bottles per person. All of which will spend the rest of their lives in a landfill.

California is trying to solve this by [requiring the industry to recycle](https://calmatters.org/environment/2020/02/california-recycling-bottle-bill-single-use-products-plastics-wine/) but as with any legislation there is opposition. Hopefully, there will be progress on that front but in the meantime, eliminating, or at least reducing, single-use water bottles is quite achievable. I found that just being willing to think ahead a little, to plan a little can put you in a position to use many fewer disposable bottles.
